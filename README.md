# RGB_SpectrumAnalyzer
Battery powered 12-band spectrum analyzer with an RGB matrix display.
The sound signal is taken from an electret microphone, amplified with an op-amp, and lastly processed using an FFT algorithm.
In addition to the display, data is also outputed through serial.

Lots of credit to: https://github.com/s-marley/ESP32_FFT_VU , most of the code used in this project is from there.
